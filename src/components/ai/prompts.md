Create another html document with form to collect from the client all relevant information about a web page that he want to build
such as website name, description, sections to select etc...
Use xs elements using daisyui and tailwind.
The <main> of the document should include the form and nothing else.
Use styled component and chose a nice theme
Lastly use the exact same form submission structure so I can the detect the submission and send it back to you!
